# Quartz Section

## Overview
The Quartz processing facility represents a precision electronics manufacturing center focused on high-tech components essential for space elevator progression and quantum processing. Unlike mass production factories, the Quartz facility specializes in low-volume, high-value components while providing silica export to support the dedicated Aluminum factory.

## Key Production Chains

### Primary Quartz Processing
- **Raw Quartz → Quartz Crystal:** Standard constructor processing for high-tech components
- **Raw Quartz → Silica:** Essential for aluminum production and specialized applications

### High-Tech Electronics
- **Crystal Oscillator Production:** Critical component for computers, supercomputers, and space elevator items
- **Radio Control Unit Manufacturing:** Advanced electronics for space elevator progression
- **Thermal Propulsion Rocket Assembly:** Final space elevator tier component

### Aluminum Factory Support
- **Silica Export:** Clean 150/min silica export to dedicated Aluminum factory
- **Resource Efficiency:** Maximizes Raw Quartz utilization across specialized facilities

### Quantum Processing Preparation
- **Time Crystal Production:** Late-game quantum material using diamonds and quartz crystals

## Strategic Importance

### Space Elevator Progression
The Quartz factory is specifically designed to support Phase 4 space elevator requirements:
- Direct production of Thermal Propulsion Rockets (1/min)
- Reliable Radio Control Unit supply (2.5/min)
- Crystal Oscillator production for various high-tech applications

### Multi-Factory Integration
This facility acts as a hub connecting multiple production chains:
- **Upstream Dependencies:** Iron (reinforced plates), Copper (cables, computers), Motors (engines, turbomotors)
- **Downstream Supply:** Computer factories (crystal oscillators), Aluminum factory (silica), Quantum factories (time crystals)

### Resource Efficiency
The dual-purpose design maximizes Raw Quartz utilization:
- 62.5% allocation to Quartz Crystal production (high-value electronics)
- 37.5% allocation to Silica production (aluminum factory export)

## Production Characteristics

### Low-Volume, High-Value Focus
Unlike mass production factories (Iron, Copper, Steel), the Quartz facility prioritizes:
- **Precision Manufacturing:** Small quantities of critical components
- **Quality over Quantity:** Crystal Oscillators and Radio Control Units
- **Strategic Timing:** Components needed for game progression milestones

### Power Scaling
The facility demonstrates efficient power characteristics:
- **Base Operations:** 362 MW for electronics production
- **Quantum Mode:** Additional 300 MW for Time Crystal production
- **Efficient Design:** Lower power consumption than mass production facilities

### Layout Efficiency
Five-floor vertical design optimizes for:
- **Progressive Complexity:** Simple processing at bottom, advanced assembly at top
- **Component Flow:** Natural upward progression of refined materials
- **Quantum Integration:** Time Crystal production positioned for quantum factory connection

## Integration Notes

### Timing in Game Progression
This factory becomes critical during:
- **Tier 7-8 Research:** Crystal Oscillator and Radio Control Unit unlock
- **Space Elevator Phase 4:** Thermal Propulsion Rocket requirements
- **Quantum Research:** Time Crystal production for advanced technologies

### Scaling Considerations
The design allows for expansion:
- **Crystal Oscillator Surplus:** 2.75/min available for computer factories
- **Silica Export:** Clean separation enables independent aluminum factory scaling
- **Quantum Preparation:** Time Crystal production ready for quantum facility integration

### Resource Node Requirements
Optimal placement near:
- **Pure Quartz Nodes:** 240/min raw quartz consumption
- **Diamond Sources:** 12/min for quantum processing (late-game)
- **Power Grid Access:** 362-662 MW power requirements
- **Transport Networks:** Multiple input/output streams for factory integration

This factory represents precision electronics manufacturing, serving as a critical bridge between established production chains and space elevator progression while maintaining clean separation from the resource-intensive aluminum production chain.
